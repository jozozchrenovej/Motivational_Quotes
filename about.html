			<b>Motivational Quotes</b><br><br>

			If you visited this page, you are probably wondering what is going on. The idea of the page is pretty simple, yet its philosophy goes beyond the primitive surface of what is displayed by html. <br><br>

			<b>How does it work?</b> <br><br>

			You simply type in any word/sentence/word query into the input field and you wait for the wonder to happen. What follows by the simple click on “Motivate Me” button would probably be described by Steve Jobs as “revolutionary”, or “it works like a miracle”. The motivational quote is displayed alongside with the “author” just slightly above the picture related to the word you entered (assuming you entered a word which you were hoping a motivational quote would be about). All the content is easily identified since it is located in a precisely designed (or, as Steve would say: “achieved through a very precise CSS engineering”) black box which creates a border and a space content for the quote and all its attributes. <br><br>

			<b>Philosophy behind the project</b><br><br>

			As mentioned above, the philosophy behind what might appear as a simple project goes actually deeper and further to the history. Since the invention of Facebook, people have been taking the advantage of an easy Facebook interface to do daily updates of their profiles. However, since the time on Earth is rather limited and people still want to express something deep, a new trend of “motivational deep statuses” has emerged recently. A “motivation deep status” usually contains a photo completely unrelated to the quote and if we are lucky, of an actual person who wrote the quote.<br><br>

			My project targets this hole on the market by providing an easy, smooth solution to people who have the need to motivate others by deep, motivational statuses with photos that are completely unrelated to the content. The webpage does the job for you: just input any word and, et voilà, a photo with a random motivational quote completely unrelated to the picture and with a wrong (random) author name appears in a black box ready to be shared on your Facebook. <br><br>

			
			<b>How is it done?</b><br><br>

			The webpage consists of pure html (manually written), very precise CSS engineering (manually written as well) and very fast javascript using the standard jQuery library. <br><br>

			The functionality is in fact very simple. Thanks to the help of jQuery and javascript the page simply pulls data from three different APIs. The first API is Flickr API for searching a picture related to the inserted word. This is the only content which is somehow related to the word/sentence which user inserts into the search field. Subsequently the Flickr API returns the first photo from the search result related to user’s input. What happens next is pure randomness. A completely random quote unrelated to what the user has inputted gets pulled from forismatic.com, which provides API for random quotes. The Forismatic API comes with the actual author of the quote, but for the sake of the real motivational deep statuses, a random name is generated by pulling data from uinames.com, which provides us with an API for accessing their database of random names. The quote and the name get append to the photo in a black box for a nice visual user experience. <br><br>

	
			<b>The Challenge</b><br><br>

			One of the main challenges for me was the positioning of everything; since it was the first time that I had to incorporate more CSS that usually. It took me a while to understand the idea behind it, but it was a great practice and I realized how helpful and important it is to have a good CSS styling. <br><br>

			Definitely the most difficult obstacle for me was the quote pulling from the Forismatic API. In the beginning, when I sent a request for a quote, the same quote would be displayed on certain browsers even after the next motivational session (meaning, clicking “Motivate Me” button again). However, thanks to professor Craig Protzel (all credits to him), we were able to fix this problem by making sure the pulled quote would not get cached in the browser and a new request would be sent. This was achieved by adding a simple command to our jQuery (ajax function) – “cache: false,”. After this fix, the random motivation quote generation seems to be working fine. <br><br>
